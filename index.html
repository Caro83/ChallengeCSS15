				<h3>WE ARE STORYTELLERS. BRANDS ARE OUR SUBJECTS. DESIGN IS OUR VOICE.</h3>
				<p>We believe ideas come from everyone, everywhere. At BlackTie, everyone within our agency walls is a designer in their own right. And there are a few principles we believe—and we believe everyone should believe—about our design craft. These truths drive us, motivate us, and ultimately help us redefine the power of design.</p>
